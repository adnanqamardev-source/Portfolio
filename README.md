# Portfolio
Data analyst crafting clear, impactful insights. I build end‑to‑end analytics projects—from ingestion and cleaning to visualization and decision support—with clean architecture and reproducible methods. I design elegant, accessible UIs (dark, glassmorphism, Tailwind) and dashboards that highlight meaningful metrics and actionable outcomes.

MD Adnan Qamar - Data Analyst & SQL Developer Portfolio
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a Data Analyst and SQL Developer.


## Description
This portfolio is built from scratch using modern web technologies to create a sleek, professional, and interactive user experience. The design features a dark-themed "glassmorphism" aesthetic with glowing accents, reflecting a modern, tech-savvy brand. The primary goal of this site is to serve as a dynamic resume and a central hub for my professional work, providing potential employers with a comprehensive look at my capabilities.

## Features
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from large desktops to mobile phones.

Glassmorphism UI: A modern user interface built with semi-transparent, blurred backgrounds to create a sense of depth and focus.

Interactive Skills Chart: A dynamic radar chart, powered by Chart.js, visually represents my technical competencies in a clear and engaging way.

Animated Code Block: A typing animation showcases a professional, real-world SQL query, immediately demonstrating my core technical skills.

Smooth Scrolling & Animations: Subtle fade-in animations and smooth scrolling create a polished and professional user experience.

Functional Contact Form: An integrated contact form using Formspree allows for direct communication without a dedicated backend server.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:

HTML5: For the core structure and content of the website.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, including animations, the mobile menu, the skills chart, and the contact form submission.

Chart.js: A powerful JavaScript library for creating beautiful and interactive data visualizations.

Formspree: A backend service that handles the contact form submissions and forwards them to my email.
